#### Augmented Reality
Building scalable and stunning apps using the latest AR technologies from Apple including ARKit, RealityKit, and SwiftUI. Code review available for your engineers to validate.

#### Virtual Reality
Creating fully immersive environments on visionOS using spherical photography and 360-degree video, optimized to reduce foveated rendering effects inherent to headsets.

#### Extended Reality
Supporting the most popular XR APIs for the web, including Apple's AR Quick Look, Google's ARCore, and WebXR, to render OBJ, GLTF, USD, and WebGL scenes seamlessly within browsers.
